# ShelfWatch
Python/MySQL library management system

This is a Library Database Management System project for CS 157A at SJSU, designed to organize and manage books, members, and borrowing activities. 

## Contributers
- Ethan Tran
- Brody Smith

## Project Overview

This application follows a three-tier architecture:
- **Presentation Layer**: tkinter desktop GUI with tabs for Books, Members, Staff, and Borrow/Return
- **Application Layer**: Python service classes that contain business logic and execute SQL directly
- **Data Layer**: MySQL relational database with tables for Books, Members, Staff, and BorrowRecords

**Features:**
- Add, update, delete, and search books, members, and staff
- Check out books to members and process returns
- Automatic overdue fine calculation ($0.25/day after a 14-day loan period)
- Borrow history log

## Dependencies and Required Software

- Python 3.10+
- MySQL 8.0+
- [mysql-connector-python](https://pypi.org/project/mysql-connector-python/) (installed via pip)
- [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/) (installed via pip, for testing only)

## Setup and Installation

**1. Clone the repository**
```
git clone <repo-url>
cd Library-DBMS
```

**2. Create and activate a virtual environment**
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install Python dependencies**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Install and start MySQL**

If MySQL is not already installed (macOS Homebrew):
```
brew install mysql
brew services start mysql
```

**5. Create the database and tables**

Run both scripts in order. The first creates the schema and the second loads seed data:
```
mysql -u root < db/create_schema.sql
mysql -u root < db/initialize_data.sql
```

> If you get a permissions error on macOS, ensure your user has read access to the `db/` directory:
> `chmod +r db/create_schema.sql db/initialize_data.sql`

## Database Configuration

The database connection is configured in `db/connection.py`. By default it connects to a local MySQL instance with no password:

```python
DB_CONFIG = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "unix_socket": "/tmp/mysql.sock",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "",
    "database": "library_db",
}
```

Update `user`, `password`, and `unix_socket` to match your local MySQL setup. On non-macOS systems, remove the `unix_socket` line.

## Running the App

```
python main.py
```

## Running Tests

Uses pytest and runs against an isolated `library_test_db` database. Requires MySQL to be running.

```
.venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v
```

Or activate the venv first and use plain `pytest`:

```
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest tests/ -v
```
